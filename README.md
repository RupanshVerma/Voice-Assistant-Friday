# Voice-Assistant-Friday
Program for voice assistant written in python language to perform different tasks (like mails, make notes, weather, Google maps, Wikipedia, solve mathematical equations, etc.) and used machine learning to study the user’s behavior on daily basis and aid them in future by itself by learning their normal day schedule and their searches and whatever tasks they perform.

Use – To help visually impaired people with computer as they can do anything with their voice only and also it helps people in normal day routine as it is an AI based voice assistant which learns the user’s behavior and aid them in future.

My Role – My role was to write down the code and implement the whole program and connect in to different webs servers like- Wolframalpha, open weather map, etc and add different commands that use might use and then I converted the python program into a single executable software to make it easy to use and easy to share. I also tested the whole program.
